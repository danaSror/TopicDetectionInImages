# TopicDetectionInImages

The goal is to download images generated by the DALLE2 algorithm and then check for the database we collected whether it is possible to check the type of images
That is, try to categorize the images according to different topics.

**My solution to the problem described is:**

1️⃣ I downloaded from various sources in Google images generated by the DALLE2 algorithm


2️⃣ I created an image database using Turicreate

3️⃣ I used the "yolo.h5" model to identify objects in images

4️⃣ I have filtered objects whose probability of correctness is below 50%

5️⃣ For each image in which more than one object was identified, I combined the names of the objects into one subject

6️⃣ I created a dictionary of all the topics identified so that the value of each topic would be all the pictures belonging to the same topic

7️⃣ I created a GIF of all the images under the same particular theme.
